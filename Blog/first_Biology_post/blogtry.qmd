You may have already guessed but I think ants are amazing creatures, and one thing I love about them is how they communicate; ants are very social creatures. Their communication ranges from chemical signals to touch and even to noise! First lets discuss chemical signal communication. Ants release chemicals called pheromones which get released from  many different glands depending on the signals intention. These pheromones  can communicate food, shelter, danger, and much more.These signals are there captured by small hairs located on the antenna of the ant called antennal sensilla, which is an ants primary sensory organ. When two ants tapp their antenna they are commmunicating extra chemicals and signals. Some of the most prominant glands which ants use to release their pheromones are called the:
 Dufour’s Gland: 
This helps them mark their territories. Similar to dogs funny enough, these glands release drop like pheromones where the ant then ahs to smear them onto surfaces that otehr ants can then sense with their own antenna.
 poison gland: 
Like the name suggests this gland releases toxic pheromones as a form of defense  and alarm signals. these pheromones trigger an immune resposne from other ants 
 Gaster and Pygidial Gland:
the pygidial gland is responsible for releasing alarm pheromones in response to danger. while gasters produce pheromones which mark their nest entrances or are released while they are defending their territory.
